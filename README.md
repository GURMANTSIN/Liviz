Productivity tracker with visualizations.
üß© Problem
Most people live under the illusion that life is long, often dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. While there are productivity apps and habit trackers, they fail to answer deeper questions like:
How much time have I already spent?
What could I have achieved in that time?
Am I truly progressing toward the life I want?

Existing tools:
Focus too much on short-term tasks and not long-term vision.
Offer little personalization or visual clarity.
Don‚Äôt create an emotional connection to time lost or time remaining.

üí° Our Solution: Life Visualizer
A personal, interactive life dashboard that visualizes:
Time already spent vs. time remaining
Personal goal progress over time
Life trade-offs (‚Äú1 hour daily = 2 weeks/year‚Äù)
Regrets and aspirations as data, not just feelings

This app helps you reflect, plan, and act‚Äîwith emotional clarity and powerful visuals.
